# tic_tac_toe

This project is a tic tac toe game in php with javascript

1) create a database name tic_tac_toe
2) import the tic_tac_toe.sql (dump file to localhost/phpMyAdmin


3) open http://localhost/tic-tac-toe/

The two players must put their names, there is a  dynamic check on database if the name is exist , the player has to put another name. Also, checking if they players have the same name, they must have different  names to proceed playing the tic tac toe game. On inlcudes/js/checkName.js with includes/checkName.php is doing that work. Moreover, i am adding on includes/message.js to help me to print messages on index.php.

The application with events is based on includes/main.js using as  main the start.php file.

Also, queries and connection is with PDO statemets  and i have added my own css file at includes/css/styles.css
